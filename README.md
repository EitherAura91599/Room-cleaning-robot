# Room-cleaning-robot
This repo includes all code for the Room Cleaning Robot

# Purpose
This code currently includes all of the functions that are necessary for the robot to drive and turn. It uses a gyroscope for its basic navigation functions, and also uses internal sensor data from the motors to correct driving errors in real-time along with the gyroscope sensor.

# Todo
- Make another program which uses these functions to make the robot move autonomously
- Make another program which enables the arm on the robot to work for it to be able to do its job
- Add machine learning to make use of the camera on the robot to add better detection of objects
- Move to C++ codebase for more functionality and stability

# Credits
This program was originally created by Alex McMinn and a friend for the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot for the First Lego League robotics program and competition. It has been customized to match the functions needed for this robot to work
